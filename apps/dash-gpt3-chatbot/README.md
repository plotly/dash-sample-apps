![demo](images/demo.gif)

This demo shows you how to build a chatbot with GPT-3. It features a highly customized UI without stepping out of Python.

The image was generated with [StyleGAN v2](http://thispersondoesnotexist.com).

This is the description we gave to GPT-3:

## OpenAI GPT-3 API Access

In order to obtain access to the GPT-3 API, you will need to [join the waitlist](https://beta.openai.com/). Once you have the API,  you can find the secret key in [the quickstart](https://beta.openai.com/developer-quickstart), and export it as an environment variable:
```
export OPENAI_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxx"
```
Where "xxxxxxxxxxx" corresponds to your secret key.

## Instructions

To get started, first clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps.git
cd dash-sample-apps/apps/dash-gpt3-bars
```

Create a conda env:
```
conda create -n dash-gpt3-bars python=3.7.6
conda activate dash-gpt3-bars
```

Or a venv (make sure your `python3` is 3.6+):
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install all the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the app:
```
python app.py
```

and visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
