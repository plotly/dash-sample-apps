Manhattan Plot allows you to visualize genome-wide association studies (GWAS) efficiently. Using WebGL under the hood, you can interactively explore overviews of massive datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of points at once, or take a closer look at a small subset of your data

You can adjust the threshold level and the suggestive line in the "Graph" tab.
