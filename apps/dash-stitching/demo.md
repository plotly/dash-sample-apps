## What does the app do?

The purpose of this app is to combine multiple images with overlapping elements into one, cohesive image. Users have the ability to upload images from their local drive or to test images from the demo.

The user will be asked to specify the number of rows and columns for the stitched result - in order to avoid errors, the number of columns should be a multiple of the number of the uploaded images. The downsample button is used for reducing the size of the image and the option of blending images is present.

If the user would like to stitch specific areas of the selected images, then the Dash Canvas Line tool (located between the Minimize and Rectangle tools) allows the user to draw lines to specify where exactly the image should be combined together. After drawing the lines, the user must click on the **ESTIMATE TRANSLATION** to view a table of measured shifts between images on the bottom left corner of the application. 

Once everything is set up, the user may proceed by clicking on the **RUN STITCHING** button. The user will be re-directed to the _Stiched Image_ tab where the final result will appear. Sliders to change the contrast and brightness of the stiched result will also be available.

To see an example, please click on the _How To Use this App_ tab to view a gif that outlines these steps.

## Getting Started with the Demo

The purpose of this demo is to show what can be done with the Stitching App. To use the demo, simply click on the **UPLOAD DEMO DATA** button as it will stage four images that can be stiched together. For this demo specifically, setting the number of rows to 1 and the number of columns to 4 will output a succesful result.
