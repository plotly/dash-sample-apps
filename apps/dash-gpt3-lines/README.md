[Try it now](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-gpt3-lines/)


This demos shows how to use GPT-3 to not only generate line charts using a given dataset (in this case, the [Gapminder dataset](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)), but also update it in real time with only natural language queries:

It only took one Plotly Express code snippet (given in the card on the bottom left) for it to learn how to generate line charts.

## OpenAI GPT-3 API Access

In order to obtain access to the GPT-3 API, you will need to [join the waitlist](https://beta.openai.com/). Once you have the API,  you can find the secret key in [the quickstart](https://beta.openai.com/developer-quickstart), and export it as an environment variable:
```
export OPENAI_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxx"
```
Where "xxxxxxxxxxx" corresponds to your secret key.

## Instructions

To get started, first clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps.git
cd dash-sample-apps/apps/dash-gpt3-bars
```

Create a conda env:
```
conda create -n dash-gpt3-bars python=3.7.6
conda activate dash-gpt3-bars
```

Or a venv (make sure your `python3` is 3.6+):
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install all the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the app:
```
python app.py
```

and visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
