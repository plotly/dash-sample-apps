# DashR Ideogram 

## About this App:

This is an interactive, chromosome viewer which displays the chromosomes of various species imported from the NCBI Taxonomy database. The interface allows you to view four different features, a custom plot with user-selectable BPHS, labelling and zoom functions, a homology feature which compares areas of two chromosomes, an annotation feature which plots annotation data onto the chromosomes, and a brush function to highlight and select areas of the chromosomes.
