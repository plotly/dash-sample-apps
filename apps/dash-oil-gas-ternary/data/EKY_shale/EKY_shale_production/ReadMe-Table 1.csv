Eastern Kentucky Gas Production Data Set,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"These data were collected circa 1985 by the BDM Corporation of McLean, Virginia, under contract to the Gas Research Institute (now Gas Technology Institute, GTI), Chicago, Illinois, and include historic natural gas production by year for Devonian shale wells in eastern Kentucky. For this data set, 1984 is the most recent year available. More recent production data by well begin in 1997 with the public release of data under 805 KAR 1:180 and are available from either the KGS oil and gas well record search pages (http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/DataSearching/OilGas/OGSearch.asp) or from the Kentucky Division of Oil and Gas (oilandgas.ky.gov). The historic data were made available to the Kentucky Geological Survey, University of Kentucky, a GRI contractor and served as the basis for the production data analyses appearing in the GRI contract reports published from 1986 to 1988. Staff of the Kentucky Geological Survey have identified the data and associated it with wells in the KGS online data base based on the best information available. Using that identification, production data have been associated with specific wells and completion intervals within those wells.",,,,,,,,,

Notes:,,,,,,,,,
Wells in this table have been identified on the basis of the best information available. Some,,,,,,,,,
wells have multiple entries indicating deepenings and recompletions. There are a few wells,,,,,,,,,
that are indicated as TRM (a permit was allowed to expire or was cancelled) or D&A (original,,,,,,,,,
completion as a dry hole and subsequently abandoned) where it can only be presumed that a,,,,,,,,,
later operation drilled or re-entered and re-completed the well and no record of that,,,,,,,,,
operation exists.,,,,,,,,,
