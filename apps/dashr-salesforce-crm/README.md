# dash-salesforce-crm
This is a demo of the Dash interactive R framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your R code.

To learn more check out our [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).

This app uses Salesforce API in order to implement a custom CRM dashboard. The API is utilized via the package [Salesforcer](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer) to query data. 
Create a free SalesForce developer trial account: [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) to utilize this API and run the app.
