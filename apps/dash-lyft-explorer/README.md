<!--
To get started, replace
Dash Lyft Perception Explorer with your app name (e.g. Dash Super Cool App)
dash-lyft-explorer with the short handle (e.g. dash-super-cool)

If this is in dash sample apps, uncomment the second "git clone https..." and remove the first one.
If this is in dash sample apps and you have a colab demo, uncomment the "Open in Colab" link to see the badge (make sure to create a ColabDemo.ipynb) first.

This shows how to build a real-time AV explorer from scratch using Dash Deck and the Lyft perception dataset. The code is easily customizable and also compatible with 3D detection models written in Python.
