## Dash Reusable Components

Creating custom, reusable components lets you improve workflow and keep repetitions to a minimum (DRY). In this app, there are a few components that have the same pattern, but with only small differences; for example, a dropdown menu with an associated name. In these cases, reusable components were useful to keep the design of those repeated components consistent, and make the app layout less crowded.
