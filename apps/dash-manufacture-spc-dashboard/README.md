## Built With
* [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) - Main server and interactive components 
* [Plotly Python](https://plot.ly/python/) - Used to create the interactive plots
* [Dash DAQ](https://dash.plot.ly/dash-daq) - Styled technical components for industrial applications

## Requirements
We suggest you to create a separate virtual environment running Python 3 for this app, and install all of the required dependencies there. Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps.git
cd dash-sample-apps/apps/dash-manufacture-spc-dashboard/
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```
In UNIX system: 

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
In Windows: 

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install all of the required packages to this environment, simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and all of the required `pip` packages, will be installed, and the app will be able to run.

## What does this app shows

Click on buttons in `Parameter` column to visualize details of trendline on the bottom panel.

Click `Start` button, trends are updated every two seconds to simulate real-time measurements. The Sparkline on top panel and Control chart on bottom panel show Shewhart process control using mock data. Data falling outside of control limit are signals indicating 'Out of Control(OOC)', and will 
trigger alerts instantly for a detailed checkup. 

Operators may stop measurement by clicking `Stop` button, and edit specification parameters for selected process line(metrics) in Specification Tab.
