    The yield curve shows how much it costs the federal government to borrow

    It is, inherently, a forecast for what the economy holds in the future —
    how much inflation there will be, for example, and how healthy growth will
    be over the years ahead — all embodied in the price of money today,
    tomorrow and many years from now.

    the economy, by making it cheaper for people to borrow money, but also

    short-term rates rose steadily.
    
    But long-term rates didn't rise very much.
    
    The Federal Reserve chairman called this phenomenon a “conundrum," and it
    raised questions about the ability of the Fed to guide the economy.
    Part of the reason long-term rates failed to rise was because of strong
