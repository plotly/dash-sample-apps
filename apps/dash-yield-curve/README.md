# Dash Yield Curve App

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

To learn more check out our [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).

## Getting Started

### Running the app locally

First create a virtual environment with conda or venv inside a temp folder, then activate it.

```
virtualenv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Or Linux
source venv/bin/activate

```

Clone the git repo, then install the requirements with pip
