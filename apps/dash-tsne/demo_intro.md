The scatter plot below is the result of running the t-SNE algorithm on the MNIST digits, resulting in a 3D visualization of the image dataset. For demo purposes, all the data were pre-generated using limited number of input parameters, a subset of 3000 samples, and displayed instantly. To train the algorithm locally, in-browser, and using your own datasets, follow the instructions on the project repo to setup the local version.
